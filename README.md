# Phonetics teaching assets

This repository contains `.svg` and `.wmf` illustrations of the vocal tract, originally developed for use in teaching phonetics.
There should be a 1:1 correspondence between the SVG and WMF assets, so if you only need one or the other, you can safely delete the folders for the unwanted file format.

These illustrations were originally created while at the Linguistics Department of the University of Washington, probably in 2010.
They are distributed "as-is" so please do not ask for additions or corrections, I *will* say "no".
